# Pathfinder Combat Helper

A web app designed to help a Pathfinder Dungeon Master to
make combat encounters more fluid and fast.

Usage guide is coming soon! If you've DM'ed Pathfinder before, you'll be able to figure
everything out by yourself.

This project is still in development. Some monsters aren't working correctly.
